# Web Scraping Challenge: Scraping the Entire "books.toscrape.com" Website

## Introduction

In our last session, we wrote a script to extract book data from a single page. Now, it's time to take your skills to the next level!

This exercise challenges you to apply and extend what you've learned to scrape the **entire** website, which contains 50 pages of book data.

**The goal of this exercise is to build your problem-solving and debugging skills.** Before you ask for help or search for a solution, try to figure out the challenges on your own. **Learning to debug is one of the most important skills you will develop as a programmer**.

## This Github Repo will guide you to the solution:

## Your Challenge: Scrape All 50 Pages

Your task is to modify the initial script to scrape the **title** and **price** of every book from all 50 pages of the [Books to Scrape](http.books.toscrape.com/) website and save them into a single `books.csv` file.

### Getting Started

1.  Use the script from the last session.('you can find the script in `one_page_scraper.py` if you didnt attend the session)  
2.  **Do not modify this file.** Instead, create a copy and name it `scraper_all_pages.py`. You will work in this new file.
3.  Your goal is to modify `scraper_all_pages.py` so that it loops through all 50 pages and collects the data.

This table lists the most important functions and attributes you will use from the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` libraries for this project.

#### `requests` Library

| **`find_all(name, class_, ...)`** | Returns a **list of all tags** that match your criteria. Perfect for looping through multiple items.      | `books = container.find_all(name="li")`                | [Link to `find_all` docs](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#find-all) |
| **`.text`**                      | An attribute that gets the text content from within a tag, with all HTML tags removed.                  | `title = book.h3.a.text`                               | [Link to `.text` docs](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#text) |
| **`.get(attribute)`**            | Extracts the value from a tag's attribute (e.g., the `href` from a link or `src` from an image).          | `link = book.h3.a.get("href")`                         | [Link to attribute docs](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#attributes) |

## how to debug Your Scraper

When your code doesn't work, don't panic! Debugging is a normal part of programming. Here’s how you can find and fix problems in your script.

### 1. `print()` is Your Best Friend
The simplest way to check what your code is doing is to print the contents of your variables at different steps.

*   **Did the request work?** Check the status code. A `200` means success!
    ```python
    response = requests.get("https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-1.html")
    print(response.status_code)
    ```
*   **Is BeautifulSoup parsing the HTML correctly?** Print a small part of the `soup` object to see the HTML structure.
    ```python
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
    # .prettify() makes the HTML readable
    print(soup.prettify()[:500]) # Print only the first 500 characters
    ```
*   **Are you finding the right elements?** Check if your `find` or `find_all` methods are returning anything.
    ```python
    books = soup.find_all(name="li")
    print(f"Found {len(books)} books on this page.")
    # If this prints "Found 0 books", your selector is wrong!
    ```
*   **Is your loop working?** Print the data you extract inside the loop for the first one or two items.
    ```python
    # Inside your for loop
    print(f"Title: {title}, Price: {price}")
    ```

### 2. Start Small
Don't try to scrape all 50 pages at once.
*   First, make your loop work for just **2 or 3 pages**.
*   Once you confirm that it's correctly fetching and saving data from the first few pages, then you can increase the range to all 50.

### 3. Read the Error Messages!
Python error messages can look intimidating, but they are incredibly helpful. Read them carefully.
*   They will tell you the **file name** and the **line number** where the error occurred.
*   They will give you the **type of error** (e.g., `AttributeError`, `IndexError`), which tells you what kind of problem it is. An `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'a'` often means your BeautifulSoup selector failed to find an element, so the variable is `None`.

### 4. Inspect the URL
Your main challenge is to go from page to page.
*   Manually navigate the website from page 1 to page 2, then to page 3.
*   Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. What part of it changes? How can you replicate that pattern in your Python code?

### HTML Structure:
```
<li>  <!-- This is the 'book' variable -->
  <article>
    <h3>
      <a> A Light in the ... </a>  <!-- The code grabs the text from here -->
    </h3>
  </article>
</li>
```



book:       <li ...>	        //This variable represents the entire list item (<li) for a single book. It's our starting point.



#### to extract the text from this example we use this format:
**title=book.article.h3.a.text** (note: book is a beautifulsoup object.)this allow us to navigate HTML using **.** book.article.
