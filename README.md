# AI and Web Scraping Sessions - IEEE 

Welcome! This repository is a collection of the sessions delivered by Mohamed and Adem. Our goal is simple: to share what we know and help you take your first confident steps into the world of AI and programming.

Think of this as your starting point. The real journey begins when you start exploring on your own.

## Our Philosophy: Learn by Doing

The most valuable skill in tech is not knowing all the answers, but **knowing how to find them**. Before you copy-paste any code from our sessions, we challenge you to try **solving the problem on your own first**.

Get stuck. Make mistakes. Break things. This is the path to true understanding. Don't rely too much on us or on AI tools like ChatGPT. Let your curiosity be your main guide.

That struggle is where real learning happens. Programming is a creative process, so be curious and have fun with it!
## How This Repository Works

This repository is organized into folders, one for each session.

-   `Session_1_Scraping_with_API_requests/`
-   `Session_2_Dynamic_Scraper/`

Inside each folder, you will find a detailed `README.md` file that explains the concepts, provides the code, and gives you a challenge to complete.

**Note:** If we run out of time during a live session, the complete code and explanations will be available here on GitHub for you to finish at your own pace.

## What's Next?

We are excited to continue this journey with you. Here are some of the topics we plan to cover in future sessions:

-   **Git & GitHub:** Learn how to manage your code and collaborate with others.
-   **Data Analysis with Pandas:** Master the powerful library for cleaning and analyzing data.
-   **Building an AI RAG System:** Dive into the exciting world of AI by building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model.

We hope you find these resources helpful. Happy coding
